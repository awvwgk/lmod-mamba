# Environment modules to setup conda & mamba

Allows seamless loading and unloading of conda environments together with lmod.
Loading and unloading conda is inspired by [CHPC-UofU/Lmod-setup](https://github.com/CHPC-UofU/Lmod-setup).
The *miniforge* or *mambaforge* installers are available from [conda-forge/miniforge](https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge/releases).
